* Caytlin Vilbrandt, the primary contributor and driving inspiration behind this project. comic\_git was originally designed to give Caytlin's webcomic [Tamberlane](https://www.tamberlanecomic.com/) a place to live, and it ended up expanding into the free open-source project you see today.

  * Discord: Caytlin, the Helper
* Jacob Gilbert, the secondary contributor and technical writer. While Ryan created most of the initial documentation, Jacob was tapped to fix it all up, make it nice and polished, and make sure the instructions make sense to readers of all experience and skill levels. Hopefully he did!
