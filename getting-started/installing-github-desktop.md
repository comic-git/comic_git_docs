# Installing GitHub Desktop

Now that you have your own GitHub repository, how are you supposed to get to your files? The simplest method is to use GitHub Desktop.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Git clients**

GitHub Desktop is not strictly required for comic\_git to work. If you have another git client you prefer to use, you can use that instead. The only requirement is that GitHub is used as your central repository, as many of the features comic\_git uses to function are GitHub specific. (See Technical Notes section for more information)

Go to the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) website. Click the **Download** link to download the app.

Once downloaded, run the app. GitHub Desktop will automatically install and launch itself.

Once GitHub Desktop has launched, the sign-in screen is displayed. Enter your username and password and click **Sign in**. (If you set up two-factor authentication, the app also asks you to enter your authentication code.)

When sign-in is successful, you are asked to confirm the configure options. Change your name if desired and click **Continue**. You may also be asked to provide anonymous usage details to GitHub. Select your preference and click **Finish**.
