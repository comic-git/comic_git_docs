# Signing Up for GitHub

The first step in getting yourself set up with a comic\_git solution of your own is creating your own account in GitHub. If you already have an account, you may log into it and move on to Creating your own Repository.

Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com). If this is your first time visiting GitHub, it presents you with a sign-up sheet. You can either enter your email address or click **Sign Up** to proceed to the main sign-up page.

When picking your username, be aware that your username will be in the URL of your webcomic. For example, if you chose the username JacobWG, your URL would start with http://jacobwg.github.io/

{% hint style="warning" %}
At some point after signing up, GitHub will send you a verification email. Please verify your email address before you get to the Uploading Your Comic section.

Due to security restrictions in GitHub, if you do not verify your email address, comic\_git will not be able to generate your website.
