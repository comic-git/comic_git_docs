# Creating your own Repository

In the last section, you created your own GitHub account. In this section, you'll create a copy of comic\_git in your GitHub account that you will use to make your own webcomic.

First, visit the comic\_git repository at [https://github.com/ryanvilbrandt/comic\_git](https://github.com/ryanvilbrandt/comic_git).

Click **Use This Template**. This creates a brand new, completely independent copy of the comic\_git repository that you can use to create your own webcomic.

After clicking **Use This Template**, GitHub asks you to name your new repository. You can select any name you desire; it may be easiest to use the name of your comic. Note that this is the name that will show up in the URL of your website later. (In the example in the picture below, the GitHub Pages URL would be http://marco262.github.io/sample-comic/)

You may add a description if desired, but it is not required.

Make sure the repository is set to **Public**. (You can publish a private repository to GitHub Pages, but it requires a [GitHub Pro](https://github.com/account/upgrade) membership.)

Once you are satisfied with the settings, click **Create repository from template**.

GitHub takes a moment to generate the new repository, then displays it. You now have your own comic playground to build how you want!
