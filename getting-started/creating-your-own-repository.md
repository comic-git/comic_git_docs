# Creating your own Repository

In this section, you'll create a copy of comic\_git in your GitHub account that you will use to make your own webcomic.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you don't have a GitHub account, follow the instructions in [Signing Up for GitHub](signing-up-for-github.md) before proceeding.
{% endhint %}

1. Visit the comic\_git repository at [https://github.com/ryanvilbrandt/comic\_git](https://github.com/ryanvilbrandt/comic_git).
2.  Click **Use This Template**, then **Create a new repository**. This creates a new, independent copy of the comic\_git repository that you own. You'll use this new repository to create your webcomic.

3. GitHub will ask you some questions about the repository you're creating. Set the requested fields as follows:
   1. **Repository template**: This should already be set to `ryanvilbrandt/comic_git`
   2. **Include all branches**: **Check this box.** If this box is not checked, GitHub Pages won't be able to display your site later on.
   3. **Owner**: This should be the username you created when signing up. If it shows something different, look into that first.
   4. **Repository name**: Choose any name you like, but we recommend the name of your comic.
   5. **Description**: This shows when viewing the GitHub repository directly, as opposed to the site you build with it. This is optional and you may leave it blank.
   6. **Public** / **Private**: This should be set to Public, GitHub requires a [GitHub Pro](https://github.com/account/upgrade) membership to use GitHub Pages with a private repository.

{% hint style="info" %}
As with your username, the name of your repository will show up as part of your website URL. For example, if you name the repository **bestcomic**, the GitHub Pages URL would be https://comicgitdemo.github.io/**bestcomic**/

4. Once you are satisfied with the settings, click **Create repository**.
5.  GitHub takes a moment to generate the new repository, then displays it. You now have your own comic playground to build how you want!&#x20;
