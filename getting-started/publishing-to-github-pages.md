# Publishing to GitHub Pages

The repository you created on the previous page is where the files for your comic are kept. In order to actually display those files as a proper website, you'll need to publish to GitHub Pages. This page walks you through those steps.

{% hint style="info" %}
Even if you've only just created your repository from the previous page, the repo comes with some default text and images as a demonstration. Feel free to publish after creating to see how it works!

1.  In your repository, go to the **Settings** tab.&#x20;

Now you're ready to make changes to your website! As soon as you do and push your changes up to GitHub, it will automatically build and deploy your website for you!

Next, we need to set up the app that will let you move your own files into the repository.
