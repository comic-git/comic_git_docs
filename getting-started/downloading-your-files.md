# Downloading your Files

With GitHub Desktop installed, downloading your files to your local PC is very simple.

Once configured, GitHub Desktop asks you to select a repository to clone and begin using. You should see your comic repository on the right side. Click the repository, then click **Clone** in the bottom right.

GitHub presents a Clone dialog. You should not need to make any changes here. Click **Clone**.

GitHub Desktop will automatically download the repository to your computer. Once completed, you are presented with the main screen you will be seeing for most of your time using GitHub Desktop.

That's it! You are now ready to make changes to create your own webcomic! Editing your Website will walk you through making changes to your website like changing the name and adding comic pages, and how to then upload those changes.
