# Downloading your Files

Now that GitHub Desktop is installed, we need to download the files in the repo to your computer, which is where you'll make changes and add files.

1.  Once configured, GitHub Desktop asks you to select a repository to clone and begin using. You should see your comic repository on the left side. Click the repository, then click **Clone** at the bottom.

2.  GitHub presents a Clone dialog. You should not need to make any changes here, but you can change the directory on your computer to install to (**Local path**) if you prefer. Once satisfied, click **Clone**.

3.  GitHub Desktop will automatically download the repository to your computer. Once completed, you are presented with the main screen you will be seeing for most of your time using GitHub Desktop.
