# Learning the File Structure

When uploading comic pages or making basic changes to your website in comic\_git, you only need to worry about the files in one directory of your repository: the `your_content` directory.

In this directory, you will see a few files and folders.

The **comic\_info.ini** file contains some site-wide info for your website, as well as controls some extra functions available to comic\_git. This is described more in [Editing your Comic Info](editing-your-comic-info.md)

The **comics** directory is where you will put your comic pages. This is described more in Adding Comic Pages.

The **colors\_and\_layouts** and **images** folders are described in [Customizing your Website](customizing-your-website.md).
