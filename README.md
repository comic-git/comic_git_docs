## **Welcome to comic\_git!**

comic\_git is a simple website written in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript that's designed to allow people with NO coding expertise to quickly and easily create a webcomic of their own, host it for FREE, and maintain it with minimal work.

**Requirements**

To use comic\_git's most basic functions, you will need to be comfortable with:

* Copying and moving files around your computer
* Making new folders
* Editing text files in Notepad

You will also learn through these instructions how to use [GitHub](http://www.github.com) and set up [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host your webcomic.

## **Quickstart**

The setup for creating your webcomic (aside from creating the art for the comic itself) can be summarized in five steps:

1. Click the "Use this template" button at the top of [the comic\_git repository](https://github.com/ryanvilbrandt/comic\_git).
2. Name your repository, and enable GitHub Pages in Settings
3. Update `your_content/comic_info.ini`
4. Add folders in `your_content/comics` for each comic page you want to upload.
5. Commit your changes and push to GitHub.

To get started, [Getting Started](getting-started/getting-started.md) will begin with showing you how to create your GitHub repository and publish it to GitHub Pages.

[Editing your Website](customization/editing-your-website.md) will instruct you on how to do things like change your website name, add comic pages, and upload your changes to GitHub.

[Extra Features](additional-information/extra-features.md) provides an overview of the features of comic\_git beyond the basic functionality, like creating an RSS Feed.

[Advanced Tips](additional-information/advanced-tips.md) provides suggestions and tips for uncommon tasks like building comic\_git locally.

## **Technical Details For Technical Folk**

comic\_git is a static website that uses Github Actions to trigger a Python script whenever a new commit is pushed to the `working` branch. This script generates all the HTML files needed for the comic, as well as extra pages like the index page and archive, using Jinja2 template files. These files are then pushed to the master branch, where they are published on GitHub Pages. Javascript is used in some places like the infinite scroll page to add extra functionality, but the vast majority of the code to build the site is in the Python scripts and the templates.

It is designed this way to make comic\_git accessible to people who aren't comfortable with installing extra programs or using the Windows command line, so running a script locally to generate static pages before upload is not an option for them. However, there are instructions for how to run the comic\_git script locally in the Advanced Tips section.
