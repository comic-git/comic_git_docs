# Expert Editing

Are you experienced in web development? Do you run your own webserver and want to run comic\_git off that? Do you want to modify comic\_git above and beyond the base application? The pages in the Expert Editing section go into deep detail on how to accomplish these and other things.

The documentation here assumes you are comfortable working with code directly (specifically Python) and have a basic knowledge of — or the willingness to learn about — more technical details above and beyond the comic\_git repositories themselves. The comic\_git team is happy to provide assistance where possible, just try not to bite off more than you can chew!
